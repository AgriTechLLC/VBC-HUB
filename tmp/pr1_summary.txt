PR #1 for bill summary feature has been successfully created and committed. The following changes were made:

1. Created app/api/bills/[id]/summary/route.ts
   - Implemented an Edge Function API route that uses GPT-4o-mini to generate bill summaries
   - Added caching with @vercel/kv to improve performance
   - Structured with error handling and fallbacks

2. Created components/bill-summary.tsx
   - Implemented a React client component using SWR for data fetching
   - Added loading and error states
   - Set up safe HTML rendering of AI-generated content

3. Updated app/(dashboard)/bills/[id]/page.tsx
   - Imported and integrated the BillSummary component
   - Added the component to the bill detail page UI

4. Added dependencies
   - Installed @vercel/kv for Redis caching
   - Installed swr for data fetching

The implementation follows best practices including:
- Edge Functions for API routes
- Client-side data fetching with proper loading states
- Caching for performance optimization
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Clean separation of concerns

Next steps for PR #2 (Amendment Diff Viewer) would include:
1. Install the diff library
2. Create the API route for generating diffs
3. Create the Amendment Diff component
4. Update the bill detail page to include the diff viewer button
