PR #2 for amendment diff viewer feature has been successfully created and committed. The following changes were made:

1. Created app/api/bills/[id]/diff/route.ts
   - Implemented an Edge Function API route that generates HTML diffs between original bill text and amendments
   - Added diffWords function from the diff library to compare text
   - Implemented caching with @vercel/kv
   - Added error handling and fallbacks

2. Created components/amendment-diff.tsx
   - Implemented a React client component with dialog modal
   - Used SWR for data fetching with lazy loading (only loads when dialog is opened)
   - Added loading and error states
   - Created proper UI for displaying text diffs with colored highlighting

3. Updated app/(dashboard)/bills/[id]/page.tsx
   - Added check for amendment availability in bill data
   - Integrated AmendmentDiff component when amendments are available
   - Added to the action buttons area

4. Added dependencies
   - Installed diff library for text comparison
   - Added @types/diff for TypeScript support

The implementation follows best practices including:
- Edge Functions for API routes
- Conditional loading for better performance
- Proper typing with TypeScript
- Accessible dialog component
- Clear visual indication of added/removed content

Both PRs #1 and #2 have now been successfully implemented and committed to the repository. The app now has AI-powered bill summaries and amendment comparison features.
